# ChemistryPassportProject
The Chemistry Passport Program provides kits at local libraries. Parent/child teams check these out and get a stamp on their passport. Kids get prizes for the stamps on their passport. To help the program expand beyond the reach that Mount Holyoke Students could physically visit the libraries, it would be great to have some kits converted to online web apps.
